The Imitation Chair was a collaboration done with artist [Kyla Schnellert](https://www.kylaschnellert.com/), she hand tufted 45 individual pieces to cover the chair. Part of an on going, bigger collection that was in a group art show. The subsequent work was born from an experience of imitation verses inspiration in art, inviting us to consider: when does an idea become something new?
