Modular audio console made with the ability to add components and rearrange, as set ups inevitably change and grow over time. The purpose of the steel spikes is to reduce the surface area of the points of contact between the equipment and the medium they are on. This allows sound waves ( vibrations ) to dissipate and not travel to the floor or speakers etc, creating less interference and more sound clarity.
